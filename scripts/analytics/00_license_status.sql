/*
================================================================
        Count of Granted, Expired, and Not Granted Licenses
================================================================

Script Purpose:
    This script calculates the number of licenses in the following categories:
    - Granted
    - Expired
    - Not Granted

Exclusions:
    - Licenses with a `NULL` status (i.e., unknown status) are excluded from the count.

Special Handling:
    - Licenses referenced in the fact table but missing from the `dim_license` table
      are assumed to be `Granted` and included in the results.
      
    Justification:
    - These records represent crop registrations tied to active licensing activity.
      Their presence implies that a valid license was issued, even if the corresponding
      entry in `dim_license` is missing. Hence, they are treated as Granted.

Assumptions:
    - License status is determined strictly based on whether the license was ultimately granted.
    - No data imputation has been applied to missing statuses; therefore, this output may not reflect
      the true distribution. It represents how the results would look assuming the available data is complete.

/*
Failed assumption:
    1. If the license signdate is between 2021 and 2022, and license status is missing then can be considered Granted
    Why Failed:
        - There case of licenses which were signed within that durationa and status is Expired.
